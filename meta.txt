Task:
Create a HTML5 Javascript application that serves as a online Javascript code editor. Users should be able to type in code in a text field and when they click the run button the code evaluates and runs the code. There should be a menu bar with actions to load files and save the text field as a file. Style it with the TailWind CSS library. There should also be a Dockerfile to run the application and it would be awesome if you made a Github action to display the static page
